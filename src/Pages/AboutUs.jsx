                Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) is the
                premier R&D organization of the Ministry of Electronics and
                Information Technology (MeitY) for carrying out R&D in IT,
                Electronics and associated areas. Different areas of C-DAC, had
                originated at different times, many of which came out as a
                result of identification of opportunities. The setting up of
                C-DAC in 1988 itself was to built Supercomputers in context of
                denial of import of Supercomputers by USA. Since then C-DAC has
                been undertaking building of multiple generations of
                Supercomputer starting from PARAM with 1 GF in 1988. Almost at
                the same time, C-DAC started building Indian Language Computing
                Solutions with setting up of GIST group (Graphics and
                Intelligence based Script Technology); National Centre for
                Software Technology (NCST) set up in 1985 had also initiated
                work in Indian Language Computing around the same period.
                Electronic Research and Development Centre of India (ER&DCI)
                with various constituents starting as adjunct entities of
                various State Electronic Corporations, had been brought under
                the hold of Department of Electronics and Telecommunications
                (now MeitY) in around 1988. They were focusing on various
                aspects of applied electronics, technology and applications.
